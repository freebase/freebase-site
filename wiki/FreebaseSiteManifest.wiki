#summary Describe the Freebase-Site Manifest System

= Introduction =

Acre allows you to version apps and libraries.

The Freebase-Site Manifest System (Manifest) was built to manage an Acre app's external dependencies by explicitly declaring them in a MANIFEST file.

Manifest provides utilities for referring to these dependencies without the need to change code when dependencies change.

It also supports client-side javascript and stylesheet (css) preprocessing including concatenation and [http://lesscss.org/ less css] support.
