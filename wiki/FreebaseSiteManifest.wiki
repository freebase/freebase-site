#summary Describe the Freebase-Site Manifest System

= Introduction =

Acre allows you to version apps and libraries.

The Freebase-Site Manifest System (Manifest) was built to manage an Acre app's external dependencies by using a single MANIFEST file.

Manifest provides utilities for referring to these dependencies without the need to change code when dependencies change.

Manifest provides dynamic client-side Javascript and CSS concatenation allowing you to modularize your code across multiple files but retrieve them with a single http request. 

Manifest supports [http://lesscss.org/ less CSS].
